Getting information from gitHub API to display on a site using Haskell:

Tutorial: https://github.com/jgaa/restc-cpp/blob/master/README.md

Haskell Turtorial consulted: https://github.com/phadej/github


This project was intially done in C++, but due to complications with the libraries, Haskell was attempted before swtiching back to C++. There has been errors in compiling the restc-cpp and boost libraries, as well as with configuring the restc-cpp.cmake files, delaying the visualizaiton process.


The main goal of the visualization was to create a bar graph that showed the commits of a each repository a user has. To test this, I used my own gitHub repository lists and commits. The first attempt of this was done using data that was written in the code, because of the issue pulling information from the rest interface. The index.html and RepoBarGraph.js files have the code for the visualization.
